Eth-todo-list
 This is a blockchain app its built using  Etherium smart contracts.


I wrote these smart contracts using solidity programming language. I've used the truffle framework to build these smart contracts.

I built the client application using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This client side talk directly to the blockchain.

I named the smart contracts Todo List. These smart contracts can add new item on the to do list, and also check out the item on the to do list.

I've used Genache as a personal blockchain network.

I've used the metamask extension to connect to the blockchain with my personal account and also to interact with the smart contracts.
